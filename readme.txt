A cool new Wordpress Woocommerce plugin that helps you to make smart collection of products.

== Description ==
The plugin provides an easy way to automatically assign your woocommerece products to relevant product categories. The plugin looks up your product title and tags, matches the key words with already available product categories and automatically assigns the product to those relevant product categories. 

This plugin will be really helpful if your website has a huge number of products and product categories. The plugin minimizes the effort of manually assigning each and every product to relevant product categories. 

For example, if you create a product with a title "IPhone 5S Reviews" and you have product categories like "IPhone", "Reviews" available, then the product gets automatically assigned to these product categories.

= Compatibility =
The plugin is fully compatible with the recent versions of Wordpress and Woocommerce.

* Compatible with older Wordpress versions, down to 3.0.
* Compatible with Woocommerce 2.0.x and 2.1.x.
* Multilingual Support is included with the plugin and is fully compatible with WPML.

= Configurable =
Woocommerce Smart Collection is completely customizable. Among others, you may enable/disable smart collection(s), append with existing categories, choose whether to generate smart category associations from product titles and tags.

From version 1.0.1 onwards, the settings can be overriden for individual products.

= Upcoming Features =
In the upcoming version we will be adding support for custom product taxonomies. So, keep a look out for the updated version. :)

= Pro Version =
There is a [Pro version](http://plugins.dualcube.com/product/woocommerce-smart-collection-pro/ "Pro version") of this plugin also available.

Pro version will give you the power to group products depending upon certain conditions (e.g. all products that have "mobile" in their title and cost less than $100). When you create new products that match the conditions, they automatically get added to that group.
